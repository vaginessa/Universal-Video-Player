00:00:00.782 --> 00:00:05.000
Today, on Spyware 2.0: "Privacy"

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.493
When we think of a private conversation,

00:00:07.593 --> 00:00:10.593
we think of it taking place between two people.

00:00:10.896 --> 00:00:12.380
And that's how it should be.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.547
Just between you and the person you're having

00:00:14.647 --> 00:00:16.715
the private conversation with.

00:00:16.815 --> 00:00:18.593
So it should be the same on Facebook.

00:00:18.693 --> 00:00:19.931
But is it?

00:00:20.031 --> 00:00:21.844
When you send private messages to your friend

00:00:21.944 --> 00:00:23.714
on Facebook,

00:00:23.814 --> 00:00:25.094
it definitely feels like

00:00:25.194 --> 00:00:27.261
you're having a private conversation.

00:00:27.361 --> 00:00:28.345
But you're not.

00:00:28.445 --> 00:00:30.544
Because you're having the conversation

00:00:30.644 --> 00:00:32.762
in Facebook's home.

00:00:32.862 --> 00:00:35.261
It's the home of a total stranger

00:00:35.361 --> 00:00:38.797
who pays the rent by spying on you.

00:00:38.897 --> 00:00:40.961
Here's how private messages work

00:00:41.061 --> 00:00:42.297
on Facebook:

00:00:42.397 --> 00:00:44.761
First: you tell this strangerâ€¦

00:00:44.861 --> 00:00:47.514
what you want him to tell your friend.

00:00:47.614 --> 00:00:48.880
The stranger takes notes,

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:50.513
and never forgets,

00:00:50.613 --> 00:00:54.381
and, finally, he relays your message to your friend.

00:00:54.695 --> 00:00:56.931
So when Facebook says "private",

00:00:57.031 --> 00:01:00.377
what they *really* mean is "public."

00:01:00.477 --> 00:01:06.264
In the novel '1984', George Orwell called this "doublethink."

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.463
To understand what Facebook, Google or Twitter mean

00:01:08.563 --> 00:01:10.961
when they say private,

00:01:11.061 --> 00:01:13.929
we have to engage in doublethink.

00:01:14.029 --> 00:01:16.514
So, who is this stranger that

00:01:16.614 --> 00:01:20.378
we're so willing to share our most personal conversations with?

00:01:20.478 --> 00:01:23.181
Let's meet the person behind Facebook,

00:01:23.281 --> 00:01:26.515
its founder, Mark Zuckerberg.

00:01:26.615 --> 00:01:29.798
In 2010. in an interview with the New Yorker,

00:01:29.898 --> 00:01:33.096
Zuckerberg admitted that he had the following IM conversation

00:01:33.196 --> 00:01:34.011
with a friend at Harvard

00:01:34.111 --> 00:01:36.963
in the early days of Facebook.

00:01:37.063 --> 00:01:39.881
Zuck says:

00:01:39.981 --> 00:01:43.299
Yea so if you ever need any info about anyone at harvard

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:45.794
just ask

00:01:45.894 --> 00:01:50.429
i have over 4000 emails, pictures, addresses, SMS

00:01:50.529 --> 00:01:52.128
his friend asks:

00:01:52.228 --> 00:01:55.380
what!? how'd you manage that one?

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:56.794
To which Zuck replies:

00:01:56.894 --> 00:01:59.347
people just submitted it

00:01:59.447 --> 00:02:00.964
i don't know why

00:02:01.064 --> 00:02:03.429
they "trust me"

00:02:03.529 --> 00:02:04.797
And here's the best bit,

00:02:04.897 --> 00:02:07.262
"dumb fucks."

00:02:07.362 --> 00:02:09.130
So what kind of business does someone

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:10.796
build who thinks of people

00:02:10.896 --> 00:02:13.295
as "dumb fucks"?

00:02:13.395 --> 00:02:15.848
A business that mines you for your personal information,

00:02:15.948 --> 00:02:17.461
and profiles you.

00:02:17.561 --> 00:02:19.882
A business that tries to understand you

00:02:19.982 --> 00:02:21.296
as deeply as possible because

00:02:21.396 --> 00:02:24.547
that's the insight that it sells to its customers.

00:02:24.647 --> 00:02:26.714
A business that studies and analyses you 24/7

00:02:26.814 --> 00:02:30.795
to understand how best to manipulate your behaviour.

00:02:31.063 --> 00:02:33.431
So, the emotional contagion experiment

00:02:33.531 --> 00:02:36.931
that Facebook published which caused so much uproar

00:02:37.031 --> 00:02:38.346
wasn't a mistake.

00:02:38.446 --> 00:02:40.460
The only mistake Facebook made

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.546
was to publish it.

00:02:41.646 --> 00:02:43.214
It was business as usual

00:02:43.314 --> 00:02:46.265
for a business where you're the quarry being mined,

00:02:46.365 --> 00:02:48.462
the livestock being farmed,

00:02:48.562 --> 00:02:51.629
the lab rats being studied.

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:53.796
This is a predator-prey relationship.

00:02:53.896 --> 00:02:56.348
And *you're* the prey.

00:02:56.448 --> 00:02:58.180
And companies like Facebook

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.633
share their insight into your life,

00:03:00.733 --> 00:03:02.879
not just with their customers,

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:05.961
but also with governments.

00:03:06.061 --> 00:03:08.962
Governments love companies like Facebook and Google

00:03:09.062 --> 00:03:12.512
because they store information about hundreds of millions of people

00:03:12.612 --> 00:03:15.047
in one easy-to-reach location.

00:03:15.147 --> 00:03:18.297
And, since the information you voluntarily hand over

00:03:18.397 --> 00:03:21.044
to a third party is not under the same protections

00:03:21.144 --> 00:03:22.133
under the law,

00:03:22.233 --> 00:03:24.547
it's both convenient and cheap for the government

00:03:24.647 --> 00:03:27.846
to ask Facebook for your data.

00:03:27.946 --> 00:03:30.294
Needless to say, none of this bodes well

00:03:30.394 --> 00:03:33.544
for the future of our human rights, our fundamental freedoms,

00:03:33.644 --> 00:03:35.878
or the health of our democracy.

00:03:35.978 --> 00:03:39.380
And that's why we started we started Ind.ie,

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.927
to create beautiful independent alternatives

00:03:42.027 --> 00:03:44.027
to the spyware companies like Facebook and Google.
